This repository stores a project done in Spring 2021 for "Computer Synthesis of Music", a course taken during my Graduate education

- Demos = Links to quick demo videos of the two different "firmwares"...

- Presentation.pdf = Powerpoint of presentation given about process, technology, and why I did this

- Schematic-v1 = schematic of build. Hand drawn - yes... sorry :/ - but details all necessary connections for circuit + sensors etc...

- micthrough.ino = C code (well, sort of) written in Arduino/Teensyduino to run on a Teensy 3.5 + audio shield

- fixedwvfrm.csd & filtbnkdcmp.csd are the "firmware" options... Though they are Csound files, they won't run in the QT environment and must be installed onto the Bela in the Bela browser IDE

- gtrverber.csd & gtrglitcher.csd are the programs used to process guitar that you hear in the piece
