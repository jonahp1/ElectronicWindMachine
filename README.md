This repository stores a project done in Spring 2021 for "Computer Synthesis of Music", a course taken during my Graduate education

- Schematic-v1 = schematic of build. Hand drawn - yes... sorry :/ - but details all necessary connections for circuit + sensors etc...

 - micthrough.ino = C code (well, sort of) written in Arduino/Teensyduino to run on a Teensy 3.5 + audio shield
